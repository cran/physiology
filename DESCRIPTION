Description: A variety of formulae are provided for estimation
    of physiologic characteristics of infants, children, and adults.
    Calculations include: body surface area, ideal weight, airway
    dead-space, the alveolar gas equation, and GFR.  Each formula is
    referenced to the original publication. Future functions will cover
    more material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical care and
    peri-operative medicine.
